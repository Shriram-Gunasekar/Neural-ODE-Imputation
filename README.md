# Neural-ODE-Imputation

This repository presents three different data imputation methods for time-series data using Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). The methods include a generative approach using Neural ODEs, imputation with Boltzmann Machines, and imputation leveraging limit cycles. These techniques are designed to handle missing or incomplete data in time-series datasets efficiently.

Key Features:

    Implementation of data imputation methods using Neural ODEs for time-series data.
    Generative imputation approach with Neural ODEs.
    Imputation using Boltzmann Machines.
    Imputation leveraging limit cycles for enhanced accuracy.
